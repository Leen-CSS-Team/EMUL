   <b>Emul, Easy mobile UI Library</b>
</p>

## Welcome!

First,welcome to see this project!

## What is EMUL

EMUL, the full name of Easy Mobile UI Library，it is a simple and practical mobile UI library，implemented by css,so it’s a bit too formal to call it a UI library.

## Getting Started

To use EMUL,you can do this in two ways:

- Introduced via link href (recommended)

You only need to use the following code to use EMUL:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://leen-css-team.github.io/EMUL/dist/css/emul.min.css">
```
Of course, this is not accelerated with a CDN (I don't have the money for a CDN either) as it is only done with the common Gitee Pages.

- Download CSS files to use

You can clone our repo to use

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Leen-CSS-Team/EMUL.git
```

- ##### Use of v0. X version

If you want to use version v0. X, please go to the "releases" page and find the "source code" package in "v0. X version changelog" to download and use.
