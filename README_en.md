# EMUL

First,welcome to see this project!

## What is EMUL

EMUL, the full name of Easy Mobile UI Library，it is a simple and practical mobile UI library，implemented by css,so it’s a bit too formal to call it a UI library.

## Getting Started

To use EMUL,you can do this in two ways:

- Introduced via link href (recommended)

You only need to use the following code to use EMUL:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://leaf2006.github.io/EMUL/input/emul.min.css">
```
Of course, this is not accelerated with a CDN (I don't have the money for a CDN either) as it is only done with the common Gitee Pages.

- Download CSS files to use

This method is not very fast, but it would be better speed, especially in the network, or use the h5 +, all have to use to this method, you can git clone in this project, or by code warehouse provide the download button to download. Zip, then the <kbd>folder CSS </kbd> ome of <kbd>.css</kbd> file to introduce to you the <kbd>.html </kbd> file, can be used.
